This is a (portable) and free driver for the Microchip MRF24J40 radio chip. It
currently only has a hardware layer for PIC18, but others will soon follow.

Writing your own HAL is easy enough; you only need to provide the I/O pin
functions for the CS' and RESET, the SPI routines to read and write and finally
a delay routine that delays at least 1 ms.

The driver is distributed under an MIT-style license. Work is in progress,
there is plenty of stuff still missing.


NOTE: The driver has a large number of so far untested features. I will be
testing it more thoroughly over the coming weeks. It is also missing proper
documentation and examples, which I also plan to add over the next few
weeks. If you intend to use it meanwhile, please feel free to ask me if you
get stuck trying to use it.
